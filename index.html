            <h3>Conversation Game</h3>
            <blockquote>
                This project is a Conversation Game designed to spark fun, witty, and sometimes deep discussions. The
                winner isn’t the fastest responder, but the one whose answers engage and entertain the most. 1. Players
                enter their names on the main screen and start the game, which displays a card with the first player’s
                name and a question. 2. Each round, a question card shows up with a player’s name, and a timer tracks
                their response time for statistical purposes. Players answer questions while others can discuss or ask
                clarifying questions. The turn ends when “Answered” is clicked, moving to the next random player. If a
                player wants to skip, they can press “Skip,” incurring a penalty point. 3. Statistics tracks fun metrics
                like player with the most skips, player with the most answered questions and player who spent the
                longest time answering. 4. The game can continue through all questions or end when players decide, with
                final stats displayed.Note: This game is designed for light-hearted fun, giving everyone a chance to
                laugh and learn about each other.
